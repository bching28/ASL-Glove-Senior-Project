# American Sign Language Glove Interpreter - Senior-Project
Communication can be difficult between a mute person and an individual with limited to no knowledge of American Sign Language, one of the primary forms of communication for someone with the inability to communicate vocally.  The design for the American Sign Language Interpreter is an effort to bridge this communication gap and enable greater accessibility in conversation between these two populations. This device is a cost-effective, portable, durable, user-friendly solution to this problem, and senses the userâ€™s input of American Sign Language alphabet letter gestures to produce audible interpretations of these hand signs. The final deliverable is a fully-functional device utilizing flexible and motion sensors that has wireless capabilities and the ability to recognize the full alphabet with an accuracy of 89.45%.  Future improvements will focus on enabling the device to be trainable for multiple users.
